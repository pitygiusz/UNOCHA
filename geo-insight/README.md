# Geo-Insight: GapFinder Assistant - Databricks App

This folder contains a live demo of the Geo-Insight app, hosted using [Databricks Apps](https://www.databricks.com/product/databricks-apps).

## Prerequisites

- An active [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) workspace
- [Claude API Key](https://platform.claude.com/settings/workspaces/default/keys)

### Table generation

In order to get the tables required for the app properly functioning, follow these steps:

1. Download appropriate datasets from the following links:
   - https://data.humdata.org/dataset/global-hpc-hno (make sure to add the year column in order to distinguish between records in provided CSV files),
   - https://data.humdata.org/dataset/global-requirements-and-funding-data &ndash; specifically, `fts_requirements_funding_global.csv` and `fts_incoming_funding_global.csv`,
   - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?end=2023&start=2001 &ndash; in this case, the resulting CSV file should be flattened so that it has 3 columns - `Country Code`, `year` and `population`,
   - https://www.acaps.org/en/data (optional) &ndash; contains monthly severity indices per crisis; requires some preprocessing before ingesting

2. Create a catalog called `unocha` and ingest the downloaded files as tables. In case of most tables, the CSV file name (or its simplified version) is used as the table name. 

3. Execute queries from the `../queries` directory in this order: `incoming_funds` and `required_funds`, `year_country_required_granted`, then `master_table_step_X`, and lastly `master_table_final`.

## Setup

### 1. Configure Databricks Secrets

The app reads credentials from a Databricks secret scope named `datathon-scope`. Create the scope and add the required secrets:

```bash
databricks secrets create-scope datathon-scope
databricks secrets put-secret datathon-scope ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --string-value <your-claude-api-key>
databricks secrets put-secret datathon-scope DATABRICKS_TOKEN --string-value <your-databricks-token>
```

### 2. Update the Warehouse HTTP Path

In `src/app.yaml`, set `DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH` to the HTTP path of your SQL warehouse. You can find it in the Databricks workspace under **SQL Warehouses → your warehouse → Connection details**.

### 3. Deploy the App

1. Go to the Databricks Apps dashboard and click **Create app**
2. Choose **Custom app** and give it a name
3. Under **Source**, point the app at this repository or upload the contents of the `src/` folder
4. Click **Deploy** — Databricks Apps will install dependencies from `requirements.txt` automatically
5. `DATABRICKS_HOST` is injected by the platform; all other secrets are pulled from `datathon-scope`

## App Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/app.yaml` | Runtime command, secret bindings, and environment variables |
| `src/app.py` | Main Gradio application and AI pipeline |
| `src/requirements.txt` | Python dependencies (`gradio` and `pandas` are pre-installed) |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `datathon-scope` secret | Claude API key for query interpretation and report generation |
| `DATABRICKS_HOST` | Auto-injected | Workspace hostname |
| `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` | `datathon-scope` secret | Token for Databricks SQL access |
| `DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH` | `app.yaml` (hardcoded) | HTTP path of the target SQL warehouse |

## App URL

Once deployed, your app will be accessible at the URL shown in the App overview.
