# Briefing Note Generator — Agent Architecture

## Context

OCHA hackathon challenge: build a system that ranks humanitarian crises by the gap between documented need and available funding, and generates briefing notes for coordinators. The system must handle politically sensitive data representing real people in vulnerable situations. The core design constraint — stated explicitly in both `challenge.md` and `workshop_notes.md` — is **not to be overconfident**: outputs must be decision support tools, not automated decision-makers.

The user also wants a filter/keyword UI so coordinators can focus on specific regions, sectors, or crisis types before running the analysis.

## Architecture: Five-Agent Linear Pipeline

> All data is loaded from pre-declared, pre-downloaded public datasets. No live web search is used — every external source is declared upfront in `METHODOLOGY.md`.

### Agent 1: `QueryInterpreterAgent`
- **Model:** `claude-haiku-4-5` (low cost, high throughput)
- **Input:** raw NL query string + UI filter state
- **Output:** `QuerySpec` (Pydantic) — structured criteria with `interpretation_confidence` + `interpretation_notes`
- **Uncertainty:** ambiguous terms (e.g. "Sahel") emit `confidence: "medium"` and a plain-English note shown in the briefing header

### Agent 2: `DataIngestorAgent`
- **Model:** none — pure Python
- **Input:** `QuerySpec`, paths to all declared datasets (primary + supplementary, see below)
- **Output:** `IngestedDataset` — list of `CrisisRecord` objects + `DataQualityReport`
- **Uncertainty:** every `CrisisRecord` has a `data_flags: [str]` field — non-optional, carries caveats like "HNO data is 3 years old", "No formal HRP on file", "IPC phase unavailable for this country"
- **Supplementary signals loaded here (no LLM, no web search):**
  - IPC phase per country — from pre-downloaded IPC Global Acute Food Insecurity CSV (ipcinfo.org)
  - UNHCR displacement figures — from pre-downloaded UNHCR Refugee Data Finder CSV (unhcr.org)
  - Donor concentration (HHI score) — computed from CBPF donor breakdown already in primary datasets
  - Prior-year coverage ratios — computed from multi-year HRP data already in primary datasets
  - Media visibility: dropped — no offline proxy available

### Agent 3: `GapScoringAgent`
- **Model:** none — pure Python (`pandas`, `numpy`)
- **Input:** `IngestedDataset`
- **Output:** `ScoredCrisisList` — ranked crises with `gap_score`, `coverage_ratio`, `score_confidence` (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), and `score_caveats`
- **Gap score formula:** `(1 - coverage_ratio) * log_pin_weight`; crises without HRP ranked separately; bare numbers never emitted — always paired with confidence tier
- **Bonus:** `structural_neglect_flag` set when underfunded for 3+ consecutive years

### Agent 4: `BriefingNoteWriterAgent`
- **Model:** `claude-opus-4-7` with `thinking: {"type": "adaptive"}`, streaming enabled
- **Input:** `ScoredCrisisList` + `QuerySpec` + `DataQualityReport` (enrichment signals are fields on `CrisisRecord` itself)
- **Output:** `BriefingNote` — executive summary, ranked table (with confidence column), top-3 narratives, methodology disclosure, limitations list (minimum 3, enforced)
- **Banned phrases in system prompt:** "the data shows", bare percentages, "X country is underfunded" without qualifier
- **Required constructions:** "available data from [source, year] suggests...", "approximately [range]", confidence level on every gap score

### Agents 5a–5c: Review Panel (run in parallel via `asyncio.gather()`)

Three independent reviewers, each with a narrow focus and extended thinking enabled. They run simultaneously on the same draft and cannot see each other's outputs — independence is the mechanism that catches what a single reviewer would rationalize away.

**5a. `FactCheckReviewAgent`**
- **Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6` with `thinking: {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 5000}`
- **Focus:** Hallucination and fabrication — does every figure in the note actually appear in `ScoredCrisisList`? Does any country, statistic, or source citation appear that wasn't in the input data?
- **Checklist:** (1) cross-reference every numeric claim against `ScoredCrisisList` fields, (2) flag any dataset name not in the declared sources list, (3) flag any country name not in `ScoredCrisisList`, (4) flag any claim using language stronger than the underlying `score_confidence` permits

**5b. `ConfidenceCalibrationReviewAgent`**
- **Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6` with `thinking: {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 5000}`
- **Focus:** Language-level overconfidence — does any prose claim a higher certainty than the `score_confidence` of the underlying record?
- **Checklist:** (1) scan for banned phrases ("the data shows", "X is underfunded"), (2) verify every coverage ratio has a confidence qualifier, (3) verify LOW-confidence records are described with appropriately hedged language, (4) check the executive summary explicitly names the most significant data limitation

**5c. `CompletenessReviewAgent`**
- **Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6` with `thinking: {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 3000}`
- **Focus:** Structural completeness — are all required sections present and all propagated flags surfaced?
- **Checklist:** (1) all mandatory sections present, (2) every `data_flag` from input `CrisisRecord` objects appears somewhere in limitations or caveats, (3) limitations list has ≥3 items, (4) `decision_support_note` present and unmodified, (5) no-HRP crises listed separately

### Agent 5d: `ReviewAggregatorAgent`
- **Model:** none — pure Python
- **Input:** three `ReviewResult` objects
- **Output:** single merged `AggregatedReview` — union of all `issues_found` across reviewers, deduplicated by location + description; overall `passed` is `True` only if all three reviewers pass
- **Logic:** `blocking` issues from any single reviewer block the note; `warning` issues are surfaced but do not block

### Orchestrator (no LLM)
```
QueryInterpreter → DataIngestor (all datasets) → GapScorer →
BriefingWriter → [5a, 5b, 5c in parallel] → ReviewAggregator →
    passed? → Final Output
    failed? → BriefingWriter (with merged issues, 1 retry max) →
              [5a, 5b, 5c in parallel] → ReviewAggregator →
              passed? → Final Output
              failed? → Final Output + issues appended to limitations
```
- Inserts mandatory `DECISION SUPPORT NOTICE` block as a Python string constant — not written by any LLM, not modifiable
- Caps review loop at 1 retry; on second failure, appends all `issues_found` to the limitations section with label "Automated review identified unresolved issues"
- Logs full pipeline run with timestamps, token usage per agent, per-reviewer pass/fail

## Query and Keyword System

The UI exposes a single natural language text input. The `QueryInterpreterAgent` extracts structured filter criteria from it and shows its interpretation visibly before running.

**Recognized keyword concepts** (see `agents/knowledge/keywords.md` for full examples):

| Concept | What to write | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| Geographic scope | "in the Sahel", "in Sudan", "across MENA" | `regions`, `countries` |
| Sector | "food crises", "WASH gaps", "health emergencies" | `sectors` |
| Crisis type | "conflict", "natural disaster", "displacement" | `crisis_types` |
| Scale of need | "large-scale", "affecting over 2 million people" | `min_people_in_need` |
| Funding gap | "underfunded", "less than 20% funded", "critical gap" | `max_coverage_ratio` |
| Time period | "in 2024", "over the past three years", "recent" | `year_range` |
| HRP status | "with no response plan", "flash appeals only" | `hrp_status` |
| Structural neglect | "chronically neglected", "forgotten crises" | `structural_neglect_only` |

The agent shows its interpretation before running:

> "Interpreted as: Sector = Food Security; Countries = Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso, Sudan, Senegal; Coverage ≤ 30%. **Confidence: medium.** Note: 'Sahel' boundary is approximate — edit your query to adjust."

The resolved `QuerySpec` is serialized into the briefing note header for reproducibility.

---

## Confidence Propagation

A shared `Confidence` enum (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW — no CERTAIN or VERY_HIGH) propagates through all agents:

- Stale HNO (>18 months) → `score_confidence: LOW` regardless of funding data quality
- Only pledged (not disbursed) funding available → `MEDIUM`
- All data current and complete → `HIGH`

The ranked table in the UI shows a **Confidence** column and a **Key Caveat** column — both non-optional. Null caveat renders as "No significant limitations identified."

## Briefing Note Structure (enforced by orchestrator)

1. **Header:** query applied + filter state snapshot + data vintage notice
2. **Query interpretation note** (if confidence < HIGH)
3. **Executive summary** (LLM-written; must name most significant data limitation)
4. **Ranked crisis table** — columns: Rank, Country, PIN (est.), Coverage, Confidence, Key Caveat
5. **No-HRP crises list** (separate, not ranked against HRP crises)
6. **Top-3 crisis narratives** (LLM-written; each must cite source, year, confidence, and what the score doesn't capture)
7. **Methodology disclosure** (150 words, plain English)
8. **Known limitations** (minimum 3, enforced by `CompletenessReviewAgent`)
9. **Data sources** (structured list with declared limitations)
10. **DECISION SUPPORT NOTICE** (Python constant, inserted by orchestrator, not LLM)

---

## Build Sequence

**Phase 1 — Data foundation (no LLM, fully testable offline):**
`src/models/` → `src/data/loaders.py` → validators/normalizers → `agents/data_ingestor.py` → `src/data/gap_scoring.py` → `agents/gap_scorer.py` → `tests/`

**Phase 2 — LLM integration:**
`src/prompts/` (write all prompts first) → `agents/query_interpreter.py` → `agents/briefing_writer.py` → `agents/fact_check_review.py` + `agents/confidence_calibration_review.py` + `agents/completeness_review.py` → `agents/review_aggregator.py`

**Phase 3 — Orchestration and UI:**
`src/orchestrator.py` → `app.py` → `METHODOLOGY.md`

---

## Verification

1. Run `tests/test_gap_scoring.py` against synthetic fixtures — validate ranking correctness and confidence tier assignment before any API calls
2. Run `agents/data_ingestor.py` against real HDX CSV downloads — verify `data_flags` are generated correctly for stale/missing records
3. Run full pipeline offline — verify `DECISION SUPPORT NOTICE` is present and unmodified in output
4. Manually review a generated note: confirm no bare percentages, all claims have source citations, limitations section has ≥3 items
